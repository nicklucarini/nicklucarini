- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on various labs so I can get a better understanding for coding
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with my IDP since I am new to coding
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love movies and tv shows
--> I do not have any previous coding experience.
I am taking this class because it sounded interesting and something that may be important in life.
My other interests include of all sports, movie making, youtube, and having fun with my friends and family.
My goals for this class is to end with a good grade that I am satisfied with and to also learn some new things that may help me in the future.
